Query Items Available for Purchase
You can query Google Play to programmatically retrieve details of the in-app products that are associated with your application (such as the productâ€™s price, title, description, and type). This is useful, for example, when you want to display a listing of unowned items that are still available for purchase to users.

Note: When making the query, you will need to specify the product IDs for the products explicitly. You can manually find the product IDs from the Developer Console by opening the In-app Products tab for your application. The product IDs are listed under the column labeled Name/ID.

To retrieve the product details, call queryInventoryAsync(boolean, List, QueryInventoryFinishedListener) on your IabHelper instance.

The first input argument indicates whether product details should be retrieved (should be set to true).
The List argument consists of one or more product IDs (also called SKUs) for the products that you want to query.
Finally, the QueryInventoryFinishedListener argument specifies a listener is notified when the query operation has completed and handles the query response.
If you use the convenience classes provided in the sample, the classes will handle background thread management for In-app Billing requests, so you can safely make queries from the main thread of your application.
The following code shows how you can retrieve the details for two products with IDs SKU_APPLE and SKU_BANANA that you previously defined in the Developer Console.

List additionalSkuList = new List();
additionalSkuList.add(SKU_APPLE);
additionalSkuList.add(SKU_BANANA);
mHelper.queryInventoryAsync(true, additionalSkuList,
   mQueryFinishedListener);
If the query is successful, the query results are stored in an Inventory object that is passed back to the listener.

The following code shows how you can retrieve the item prices from the result set.

IabHelper.QueryInventoryFinishedListener 
   mQueryFinishedListener = new IabHelper.QueryInventoryFinishedListener() {
   public void onQueryInventoryFinished(IabResult result, Inventory inventory)   
   {
      if (result.isFailure()) {
         // handle error
         return;
       }

       String applePrice =
          inventory.getSkuDetails(SKU_APPLE).getPrice();
       String bananaPrice =
          inventory.getSkuDetails(SKU_BANANA).getPrice();

       // update the UI 
   }
}

Improtant ! I've spent a lot of time trying to find out why I'm getting error "Error Authentication is required.You need to sign into your google account". And after a lot of hours I found out - I was trying to access wrong item id from the console. In the developer console subscription item had id "premium" and I've tried to access "premium_version" item. Stupid mistake but error from google is absolutely not informative. Hope this helps


Solved, It was only mistake of product Id, The product Id from Play-store and in app SKU_NAME should be same for in app billing.


It is not mention properly in iab sample project which one is productId 
i.e SKU_GAS ="gas" and SKU_PREMIUM="premium" in project 
then 
"gas" and "premium" must be available on play-store as productId.

1) Sync the test account with your device.
2) In google play, choose test account in drop-down box.
3) click the link  https://play.google.com/apps/testing/xyz.abc.mnp to install alpha build (make sure you are signed in with test account)
4) once build is installed, remove the "test account" from synced accounts.
[Without removing test account I am getting some error (REC S-7 A5).]
5) now test IAP within application.
