 Point Gradle to your Android SDK: either have $ANDROID_SDK and $ANDROID_NDK defined, or create a local.properties file in the root of your react-native checkout with the following contents:

sdk.dir=absolute_path_to_android_sdk
ndk.dir=absolute_path_to_android_ndk
Example:

sdk.dir=/Users/your_unix_name/android-sdk-macosx
ndk.dir=/Users/your_unix_name/android-ndk/android-ndk-r10e

must cd to project folder
To bundle JS file into your apk while having your server running (react-native start) download bundle into assets directory of your app:

curl "http://localhost:8081/index.android.bundle?platform=android" -o "android/app/src/main/assets/index.android.bundle"
With the next release (0.12) we'll fix react-native bundle command to work with android projects as expected.

$ cd your_project_dir
$ npm start  # start the packager if not started already
$ curl "http://localhost:8081/index.android.bundle?platform=android?dev=false" -o "android/app/src/main/assets/index.android.bundle"


adb reverse tcp:8081 tcp:8081 //only for android 5.0 and higher
react-native run-android
cd android && ./gradlew :app:installDebug && adb install app/build/outputs/apk/app-debug.apk

**************

Configure your app to connect to the local dev server via Wi-Fi
Make sure your laptop and your phone are on the same Wi-Fi network.
Open your React Native app on your device. You can do this the same way you'd open any other app.
You'll see a red screen with an error. This is OK. The following steps will fix that.
Open the Developer menu by shaking the device or running adb shell input keyevent 82 from the command line.
Go to Dev Settings.
Go to Debug server host for device.
Type in your machine's IP address and the port of the local dev server (e.g. 10.0.1.1:8081). On Mac, you can find the IP address in System Preferences / Network. On Windows, open the command prompt and type ipconfig to find your machine's IP address (more info).
Go back to the Developer menu and select Reload JS.
